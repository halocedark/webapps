=========================

This "Rich Text Editor" uses the following:

- bootstrap (css, js).
- popper.js (for drop downs).
- font-awesome (css only).

All those files above are available with the editor, so you just need to include them.

Note: include order is required to avoid "File not found errors" or such.

Your includes should be like this:

Before the </head> tag add:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/all.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/wysiwyg.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/your-style.css">

Before the </body> tag add:

<script type="text/javascript" src="js/popper.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/wysiwyg.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/your-script.js"></script>

How to use:

In your javascript file inside "$( document ).ready(function() {});" jquery function:
1- Create new instance of "RichTextEditor()" class and pass parent element for the editor like this: 
	var richTextEditor = new RichTextEditor( $('.wysiwyg-wrapper') );
	{ $('.wysiwyg-wrapper') } // this is a div element created in the DOM where we're going to put the editor
2- You're done.

Submit to php file:

This is how to submit editor info to for EX: "new-post.php" file:
1- After you created new instance of editor class, you'll have access to manipulate editor's default behaviour for EX: form "action" attribute, let's set it to our file above so that our editor will send info to allow us to process those info in that file, we'll do that with simple steps:

richTextEditor.setAction('new-post.php');

2- That's it, now go to your browser and "inspect elements", notice that form "action" is set to our file.
3- Now you can see elements name attribute to handle them in that php file we've set, easy squeezy :).
4- You're done.

With ajax:

1- Make sure you're submitting to the right file: richTextEditor.setAction('new-post.php');
2- Call submit method with callback function to get response back:
	
	richTextEditor.submit(function(data)
	{
		console.log(data); // data is returned as JSON
	});
3- You're done.

If you like my application give it feed back and share with others.
